# Memory Card Game

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates React's hooks and states to simulate a memory game: the player earns points by clicking on various cards and ensuring that they don't click on the same card on twice. I implemented axios in order to fetch Pokémon API that is displayed on each card and styled using Tailwind CSS.
